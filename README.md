How to present videos in markdown files and GitHub Pages

## Embedded Video using iFrame 

This will only work when your ReadMe page has been converted to GitHub pages

This iFrame code generates embedded video below, remember when it's on the ReadMe and not viewed within the GitHub pages it will just appear as the raw iFrame code.

Below will only appear as embedded video when previewed on the GitHub pages otherwise it will just look like this on the ReadMe:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/291ET6Py6H8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
